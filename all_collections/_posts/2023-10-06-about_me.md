Hello ðŸ‘‹, my name is Jason Hensley. I live in TX with my loving wife Ellen, our dog Tucker, and a whole lot of projects I will eventually get to work on one day. ðŸ™‚ (Hopefully some that I will get to share with you here.)

I have been working in the IT industry since I was 19 years old where I was fortunate enough to get my start as a Unix/Linux Systems Administrator working for a Telecom provider called XO Communications. 

I have held several titles since then, worked in different sectors, and met some truly amazing people along the way. If you want to know more about my professional experience, I have a page dedicated to this [here](/posts/resume/index.html).

## Plans
Some of the content you can expect to find here:

- Technical documentation
- Tutorials & demonstrations
- Project overviews
- Reflections & lessons learned

This could change over time, but my goal is to regularly add content and share what I have learned in the hopes that it can be of use to others. 

## Interests & Hobbies
Some interests I have outside of work...

##### Building/modding GameBoy's
Look, I really don't understand why I find this so enjoyable, I just do... I am going to completely blame my little brother [Jacob](https://jacobhensley.dev) for getting me into this hobby. I secretly enjoy the building/tinkering/modding more than I do actually playing games on them (I have admittetly lost some hours to Tetris, though.)

Here are a couple I have modded so far:

#### Skateboarding

I have been skateboarding ðŸ›¹ since I was 12 years old, so at the time of writing this, 18 years now. Though I have taken a couple of breaks here and there its something I plan on continuing to do in some capacity until I physically can't anymore. 

There is something therâ€‹aâ€‹peuâ€‹tic about it that I can't seem to find in anything else. I have learned alot about myself through skateboarding as well as the world around me. One of my good friends [Eric](https://www.ericjkuhns.com/) has a [video](https://youtu.be/8iOpff_LtOA?si=59BqGW6BLsaUOO3X) about how skateboarding has impacted others throughout their professional life. 

I think the most silence I have experienced in life has been while on my skateboard.
