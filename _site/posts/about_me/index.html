        <div class="content"><p>Hello ðŸ‘‹, my name is Jason Hensley. I live in TX with my loving wife Ellen, our dog Tucker, and a whole lot of projects I will eventually get to work on one day. ðŸ™‚ (Hopefully some that I will get to share with you here.)</p>

<p>I have been working in the IT industry since I was 19 years old where I was fortunate enough to get my start as a Unix/Linux Systems Administrator working for a Telecom provider called XO Communications.</p>

<p>I have held several titles since then, worked in different sectors, and met some truly amazing people along the way. If you want to know more about my professional experience, I have a page dedicated to this <a href="/all_collections/_posts/2023-10-07-resume.md">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="plans">Plans</h2>
<p>Some of the content you can expect to find here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Technical documentation</li>
  <li>Tutorials &amp; demonstrations</li>
  <li>Project overviews</li>
  <li>Reflections &amp; lessons learned</li>
</ul>

<p>This could change over time, but my goal is to regularly add content and share what I have learned in the hopes that it can be of use to others.</p>

<h2 id="interests--hobbies">Interests &amp; Hobbies</h2>
<p>Some interests I have outside of workâ€¦</p>

<h5 id="buildingmodding-gameboys">Building/modding GameBoyâ€™s</h5>
<p>Look, I really donâ€™t understand why I find this so enjoyable, I just doâ€¦ I am going to completely blame my little brother <a href="https://jacobhensley.dev">Jacob</a> for getting me into this hobby. I secretly enjoy the building/tinkering/modding more than I do actually playing games on them (I have admittetly lost some hours to Tetris, though.)</p>

<p>Here are a couple I have modded so far:</p>

<h4 id="skateboarding">Skateboarding</h4>

<p>I have been skateboarding ðŸ›¹ since I was 12 years old, so at the time of writing this, 18 years now. Though I have taken a couple of breaks here and there its something I plan on continuing to do in some capacity until I physically canâ€™t anymore.</p>

<p>There is something therâ€‹aâ€‹peuâ€‹tic about it that I canâ€™t seem to find in anything else. I have learned alot about myself through skateboarding as well as the world around me. One of my good friends <a href="https://www.ericjkuhns.com/">Eric</a> has a <a href="https://youtu.be/8iOpff_LtOA?si=59BqGW6BLsaUOO3X">video</a> about how skateboarding has impacted others throughout their professional life.</p>

<p>I think the most silence I have experienced in life has been while on my skateboard.</p>
